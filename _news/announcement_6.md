As a team member of Megvii(Face++) and R4D Team, we won the 1st place of COCO Panoptic Segmentation and Mapillary Panoptic Segmentation in the [COCO & Mapillary Panoptic Segmentation Challenge 2018](https://cocodataset.org/workshop/coco-mapillary-eccv-2018.html). I was invited to present at COCO & Mapillary Joint Workshop at ECCV2018 in Munich, Germany.
