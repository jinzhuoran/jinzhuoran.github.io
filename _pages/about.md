[//]: # (As a Senior Research Scientist at **Kunlun Tech**, I lead a team developing cutting-edge large multimodal models, with expertise in Diffusion and VLM technologies. My tenure at **Meituan's Autonomous Delivery Department** as a Research Scientist equipped me with a robust understanding of real-world applications of AI.)

My academic journey was further enriched by a visiting Ph.D. position at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, **University of Adelaide**, where I worked closely with [Prof. Chunhua Shen]&#40;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ljk2BvIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&#41;. During my doctoral studies, I received the **Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award** &#40;one of only 10 students in the country&#41;.)

I was part of the winning team at the COCO & Mapillary Panoptic Segmentation Challenge 2018.)

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D student at the Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering (NLKE) Group, [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://www.ia.ac.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jun Zhao](https://nlpr-web.ia.ac.cn/cip/english/~junzhao/index.html). Before that, I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2021. My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and Knowledge Engineering.



My passion lies in tackling complex problems in computer vision and artificial intelligence. I have made significant contributions to the fields of semantic/panoptic segmentation, behavior prediction, and vision-language models. Among my most notable works are:
- [BiSeNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Changqian_Yu_BiSeNet_Bilateral_Segmentation_ECCV_2018_paper.html) (Rank 10 in ECCV 2018 Top-10 Influential Papers & Citation > 2500).
- [BiSeNetV2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-021-01515-2) (IJCV & ESI & ESI-Hot & Citation > 1000).
- [DFNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Yu_Learning_a_Discriminative_CVPR_2018_paper.html) (CVPR & Citation > 900)
- [Lite-HRNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Yu_Lite-HRNet_A_Lightweight_High-Resolution_Network_CVPR_2021_paper.html) (CVPR & Citation > 300)
